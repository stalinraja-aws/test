
1. Try to run as much as Docker images
2. Then try to create new Docker images.
3. Create a Docker image push in to Docker Hub.
4. For Operation Team - Needs to good at running containers and Networking section.
5. Developer Team  - Building a Docker image in a efficient way.


Kubernetes:
I. Why Kubernetes: 

	1. Micro Service Architecture
	2. Non Functional requirements - 
		a) Container Orchestration - Manage 1000s of microservices declaratively.
		b) Features				   - Auto Scaling, Service Discovery, Load Balancing, Self Healing, Zero Downtime Deployments. 
		c) Cloud Neutral		   - Standardized platform on any infrastructure.

* Docker Swarm is alternative microservices for Kubernetes.
* Easiest way to run kubernetes is Cloud Platform.
* 	

		a) AKS - Azure Kubernetes Services.
		b) GKS - Google Kubernetes Services
		c) EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Services(for AWS ECS)

* Operation team and Developer team needs to know about Kubernetes.

How do i get Started:
* Use Kubernetes in local machine is not a good option(not recommended one).
* TO learn about Kubernetes Use Google cloud free tier account.
	a) Create a Container 
	b) Deploy it to kubernetes
	c) Try and Create multiple instances
	d) Instances communicate with each other.
	e) Create a Cluster in the cloud and deploy something.
	f) Declarative Configuration.
	g) Helm Concept. - Helps to avoid duplication.
	h)
